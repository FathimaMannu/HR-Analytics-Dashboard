HR Analytics Dashboard 📊✨

Unlock the story behind employee data with Power BI!

Welcome to my HR Analytics Dashboard, built to explore and visualize employee attrition trends, department-wise stats, and workforce insights — all in one interactive Power BI file!

“Data is the new oil. But refined data is rocket fuel.” 🚀

Project Overview 🧐

This dashboard helps answer critical HR questions:

Why are employees leaving?

Which departments face high attrition?

Does gender, marital status, or training influence employee retention?

With just a few clicks, you can filter and explore trends based on gender, department, job role, overtime, and more!

Dashboard Highlights ⭐ Here are some key metrics from the dashboard:

👥 Total Employees: 1470

📉 Attrition Rate: 16%

💵 Average Hourly Rate: $65.89

⏳ Average Tenure: 7.01 years

Key Visuals 🧩

Donut Charts: Attrition by Gender & Marital Status

Bar Graphs: Department vs Attrition

Line Charts: Training Time vs Working Years

Column Charts: Age vs Attrition (split by gender)

Filters/Slicers: Department, Job Role, Education, etc.

Tip: Use the slicers on the dashboard to explore different employee groups and find patterns!

Tech Stack 🛠️

Power BI: For visualizing data interactively

Python (pandas): For cleaning & preparing the dataset

GitHub: For sharing and collaborating

Data Cleaning Process (Python) 🧼🐍

Before importing into Power BI, the raw data was cleaned using pandas:

import pandas as pd

#load the dataset

df=pd.read_csv("WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition (1).csv") print(df)

#drop irrevelant column

df.drop(columns=['EmployeeCount','Over18','StandardHours','EmployeeNumber'],inplace=True)

#Create some features

df['IsOverTime']=df['OverTime'].map({'Yes':1,'No':0}) df['AttritionFlag']=df['Attrition'].map({'Yes':1,'No':0}) df['YearsWithCompanyRatio']=df['YearsWithCurrManager']/df['TotalWorkingYears']

#fill any missing values

df.fillna(0,inplace=True)

#check missing values

df.isnull().sum() df.to_csv("HR_Anlaytics.csv",index=False)
